## general-info

A program is created that is used to manage employees and assign them various tasks.

Employees should be able to be added, edited and deleted within the program. All important data is stored for each employee.

Similar to employees, work orders should also be able to be created, edited and deleted.

Furthermore, the program should collect information about employees and shifts, such as working hours, overtime, vacation/sick days, etc.

Based on this data, the program should be able to independently divide employees into shifts so that all employees are treated equally and fairly.


# technologies

The rest of the program is developed in the programming language: Python.
